- Create “master” class containing walls, sources, receivers + all functions
- include reflection paths plotting into main as well
- plotting of TFs (not just IFs)

- mic topology plotter should detect if the array is 3D or 2D (does it have depth in all 3 directions) and if 3D, plot in 3D otherwise stay like as is

- file export of IRs (format?)

- Make a plotter class...?

- "Interleaving" generation of all image sources & audibility checking:
	- don't generate ALL image sources and then audibility check for each receiver individually
	- instead, when generating an image source, already run the audibility check for all receivers

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?
