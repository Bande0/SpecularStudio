IR estimation:
---> it seems like the longer the block size the more accurate the TF estimation is. Make it adaptive wrt. to signal length

- file export of IRs (format?)
	- json format?
	- content:
		- source location(s)
		- receiver location(s)
		- walls
		- IRs
--> try to read it back in and apply. See if you get the same results

- plotting of TFs (not just IRs)

- Make a plotter class?
	- contains all the plotter functions and a common colours list for all

- "Interleaving" generation of all image sources & audibility checking (to avoid memory issues)s:
	- don't generate ALL image sources and then audibility check for each receiver individually
	- instead, when generating an image source, already run the audibility check for all receivers

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?

- When beamforming/EC evaluation part is done, try the free Treble tool trial and inspect the differences
