- Create “master” class containing walls, sources, receivers + all functions
- create main.m
- include room + reflection paths plotting into main as well
- flotting of TFs (not just IFs)

- load configs from json (?) files instead of typing in main
- Room designer: should export room in config format which the main can load
- Mic topology designer: should import config from room designer. Should plot mic array topology separately (with “squish rectangle”) and also “in context” in the room

- proper (?) file export of resulting mic signals
- file export of IRs (format?)

- Make a plotter class...?

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?
