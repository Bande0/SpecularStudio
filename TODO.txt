- Create “master” class containing walls, sources, receivers + all functions
- create main.m
- include room + reflection paths plotting into main as well
- plotting of TFs (not just IFs)

- main should:
	- import room config (including sources)
	- import array config
	- define source signals (crash if no. signals is not the same as no. sources in config)
	- apply offset and rotation to array config
	- plot full setup (room, sources, array)
	- define sources manually
- test main with imported sources as well as manually defined sources
- test main with manually defined room config in file (including room with no sources in file but sources defined in code)

- file export of IRs (format?)

- Make a plotter class...?

- "Interleaving" generation of all image sources & audibility checking:
	- don't generate ALL image sources and then audibility check for each receiver individually
	- instead, when generating an image source, already run the audibility check for all receivers

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?
