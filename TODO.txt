- bug(?) - how can it be that in some IRs, it's not the main reflection that has the highest amplitude?? (reproduce: 1st order reflection, mic 1 and mic 9)

- plotting of TFs (not just IFs)

- file export of IRs (format?)

- Make a plotter class?
	- contains all the plotter functions and a common colours list for all

- "Interleaving" generation of all image sources & audibility checking (to avoid memory issues)s:
	- don't generate ALL image sources and then audibility check for each receiver individually
	- instead, when generating an image source, already run the audibility check for all receivers

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?

- When beamforming/EC evaluation part is done, try the free Treble tool trial and inspect the differences
