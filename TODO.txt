- plotting of TFs (not just IRs)

- Make a plotter class?
	- contains all the plotter functions and a common colours list for all

- "Interleaving" generation of all image sources & audibility checking (to avoid memory issues)s:
	- don't generate ALL image sources and then audibility check for each receiver individually
	- instead, when generating an image source, already run the audibility check for all receivers

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?

- When beamforming/EC evaluation part is done:
	- try running an evaluation on exported audio signals (or inline audio signals) and on signals acquired by re-loading and applying saved IRs. I can see there is a difference in the resulting signals but how does it affect the EC/beamformer?
	- try the free Treble tool trial and inspect the differences
