- Create “master” class containing walls, sources, receivers + all functions
- plotting of TFs (not just IFs)

- file export of IRs (format?)

- Make a plotter class
	- contains all the plotter functions and a common colours list for all

- "Interleaving" generation of all image sources & audibility checking:
	- don't generate ALL image sources and then audibility check for each receiver individually
	- instead, when generating an image source, already run the audibility check for all receivers

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?
