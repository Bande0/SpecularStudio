- Create “master” class containing walls, sources, receivers + all functions
- create main.m
- include room + reflection paths plotting into main as well
- plotting of TFs (not just IFs)

- load configs from json (?) files instead of typing in main

- Room designer: should export room in config format which the main can load
- Mic topology designer: should import config from room designer. Should plot mic array topology separately (with “squish rectangle”) and also “in context” in the room
- Sources designer? defining locations AND SIGNALS of sources...
---> where should these three come together? A "master designer"? Or what

- proper (?) file export of resulting mic signals
- file export of IRs (format?)

- Make a plotter class...?

- "Interleaving" generation of all image sources & audibility checking:
	- don't generate ALL image sources and then audibility check for each receiver individually
	- instead, when generating an image source, already run the audibility check for all receivers

- Add more advanced absorption modelling (using filtfilt)?
